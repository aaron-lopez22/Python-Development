Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

While working on my final project. I realized how easy it is to make quick changes to functions while not making huge changes to a mass amount of code. What I mean by that is usually when writing code if you want
a differenct outcome or a different number you have to change lots of the code. With the function I can continue to use with different outcomes just by continuing to call the funtion



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

It allows you to continue to make changes and test them out to get the outcome you want by asserting it in the test.
You can also use it to see how many of your functions are working properly and pin point which ones are not individually. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

One of my process has been making sure I go through each step one by one before making more of the code. 
I need to work more with using the debug feature to go through the steps.
